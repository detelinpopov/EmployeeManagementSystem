# EmplyeeManagementSystem
 
This is an application allowing us to manage a hierarchical structure of employees in the company. The system should allow us to have top-level management, expressed as root elements, having leaf elements of all with all directly managed employees, which have their own managed employees, generating a standard tree structure of the company hierarchy.
